# Snake-Game-through-C
This C program simulates the game “snake” which is usually available in old mobile phones.
A string of characters moves on the screen according to arrow keys pressed by user. If it 
touches itself or screen boundary, the program terminates. When the snake moves, in 
arbitrary screen positions character ‘F’ appears.
The objective of the game is to make the snake eat the character, so that it is added to the 
score. When a character is eaten, the score increases by the number of characters eaten.
In this version of the game there are provisions for saving / loading too.
It is a fun and entertainment-based application which brings back old memories of the classic 
“Snake” game
